# A Digital Humanities Approach to Casualties of the Northern Ireland Conflict

The project has three components:

1) Data - to make freely available the details of all killings in the Northern Ireland conflict, with the option to search and filter

2) Dynamic visualisation - to enable insights into patterns in the data, and draw attention to exceptions

3) Transparency - to openly acknowledge the difficulties and limitations of this data so as to inform interpretations of it
